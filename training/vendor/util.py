# lerobot's PI0.5 loader logs two warnings on every load that look like failures
# and are not. Both are artifacts of how it re-implements from_pretrained:
#
#   "Vision embedding key might need handling: ...patch_embedding.weight/.bias"
#       _fix_pytorch_state_dict_keys warns on any key containing
#       "patch_embedding" in case a checkpoint needs remapping. Ours does not --
#       both keys are present in model.safetensors under the names the model
#       expects, and they load normally.
#
#   "Missing keys when loading state dict: 1 keys
#      - ...paligemma.model.language_model.embed_tokens.weight"
#       PaliGemma's text config sets tie_word_embeddings=True, so embed_tokens
#       and lm_head are the SAME tensor and safetensors stores it once, as
#       lm_head.weight. Loading lm_head fills the embedding table through the
#       shared storage; the key is absent by design, not lost.
#
# Filtered at the root logger (lerobot calls the module-level logging.warning,
# so records go to root) and only for these exact prefixes -- every other
# warning still comes through.
# The tied-embedding report is print()ed rather than logged, so it needs the
# stdout filter below -- EXCEPT inside a Ray Train worker, where Ray Train v2
# patches builtins.print to forward through the root logger instead
# (ray/train/v2/_internal/logging/patch_print.py), which is why these two lines
# are listed for both filters. Matched exactly, not by prefix: the header
# carries its "1 keys" count and the bullet its full key name, so a load missing
# anything ELSE still reports in full instead of being silently swallowed.

    * `require_all=True` waits for EVERY GPU node, which is right before Ray
      Train, since it places one worker per GPU.
    * `per_gpu=True` (default) scales each node's budget by the workers that
      will actually land on it, so a 4-GPU node asks for 4x what a single-GPU
      node does. Pass `per_gpu=False` for a flat per-node budget.
    * `num_workers` caps that multiplier at the number of workers the run
      actually requests, so pinning a 4-GPU cluster to 2 workers budgets for 2.

    Returns True once the cluster qualifies; False on timeout (caller decides).
